This repository contains all the files for the media facade workshop. The whole Toolkit consists out of an Arduino which has a light sensor and a led strip with 60 leds connected to it. The source code for the Arduino can be found under /Arduino. Furthermore you will find a TouchDesigner file in this repository which is the main app for exploring the Toolkit.
